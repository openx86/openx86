2.3.2 Instruction Pointer
The instruction pointer, Figure 2-2, is a 32-bit register
named EIP. EIP holds the offset of the next instruction
to be executed. The offset is always relative
to the base of the code segment (CS). The lower
16 bits (bits 0Â±15) of EIP contain the 16-bit instruction
pointer named IP, which is used by 16-bit
addressing.
